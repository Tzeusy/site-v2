Documenting some of my finds across the internet, with various overlaps with my interests. Not including many of the more mainstream ones:

- [Slate Star Codex](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) (Now [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) on Substack). The blog of an essayist/psychiatrist, who talks about almost any topic under the sun. I often cite his articles to friends!
  - Was introduced to his blog through [Unsong](https://unsongbook.com/), an... extremely creative, fantastical take on religion and the interpretability of religious texts (specifically the kabbalah). I'm not religious, but this was a particular treat.
  - Tangentionally related are the various interests to the r/rational subreddit: some common authors include Eliezer Yudkowsky and DaystarEld (rational fiction writing).
- A delightful reddit community called [The Motte](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/), which tries to eliminate biases and encourage reasoned, measure debate between community members.
- [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/) - Economics blog, often citing other articles of interest.
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) - A movement about optimizing one's "bang for your buck" in philantrophy
- [Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine) - Excellent financial journalism.
- [Hindenburg Research](https://hindenburgresearch.com/) - A company which discovers shortable companies through thorough research. Not exactly a news publication, but essentially a profit-driven investigative journalism outfit.
- [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/) - Founder of Ethereum; he blogs about many of his ideas on the effective infrastructural design of decentralized platform, along with the many ensuing challenges.
- [Dan Wang](https://danwang.co/) - a global macro researcher focused on China. He blogs on economics, geopolitics, scifi, sociopolitics, and many other topics in a similar vein. Discovered this while reading up on China's recent crackdowns within their Education and Tech sectors

Some perhaps less credentialed but still fun discoveries:

- [Kontinentalist](https://kontinentalist.com/) - Data driven journalism in Singapore!
- [The Woke Salaryman](https://thewokesalaryman.com/) - Financial independence- oriented graphics, Singapore-flavoured

As part of an effort to make myself more accountable I might start actually blogging about my thoughts on various articles I come across!
