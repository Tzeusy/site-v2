### About


Project Jessica was a project a group of us started building when trying to test the feasibility of using robotic arms for automating food preparation processes. It consisted of the following:


1. A Niryo One arm - 3D printed 6 axis robotic arm, [https://niryo.com/niryo-one/](https://niryo.com/niryo-one/)
2. ROS Stack running on a Raspberry Pi (which also provides WiFi capability for wireless usage)
3. An electronic coffee machine (the kind that uses small Nescafe capsules)
4. Arduino for interfacing between low-level electronics and the Pi via serial communications


This system was to be fully independent of user input beyond supplying a capsule at a 'target' point: upon detection of a capsule, the arm would handle all cup navigation, coffee machine activation, and the like. Everything was controlled by the Raspberry Pi housed inside the Niryo One's casing.

*Our arm got featured by the Niryo One team!*


We also received an Outstanding Contribution to Pillar award from the SUTD Engineering Product Development pillar, who went on to showcase the arm at various EPD events as a demonstration of EPD-related skillsets.
