This post was generated by an LLM from a structured hardware reference document that I maintain as the source of truth for my homelab. I wrote and maintain the underlying specs — the LLM drafted the prose. While I've reviewed the output, hardware specs and pricing shift frequently. Verify independently before making purchasing decisions.

## Overview

I've written separately about the [motivations](/blog/homelab-motivations) behind my homelab — the *why* behind the decisions. This post is the *what*: the specific hardware I landed on, what it cost, and the tradeoffs I accepted along the way.

My homelab sits at what I'd call the **Standard Build** tier — three compute nodes with HA capability, a dedicated NAS, a managed switch with both 2.5GbE and 10GbE connectivity, and a UPS to keep everything alive through occasional power hiccups. The total bill came to roughly SGD $7,500 (my girlfriend's enthusiasm for this line item was… restrained), which felt like a reasonable balance between "enough to run real workloads" and "not so much that I'd lose sleep over it."

## Server Hardware

### Why Mini PCs

I considered used rackmount servers — a Dell R640 or HP DL360 Gen10 can be had for ~$300–600 and offers absurd amounts of RAM and expandability. But they idle at 100W+ each, they're loud, and in a Singapore HDB flat (where space and noise tolerance are both limited), that's a hard sell. Mini PCs idle at a fraction of the power, run near-silent, and still pack serious compute for homelab workloads.

### The Pick: Minisforum MS-01

I went with three **Minisforum MS-01** units in the barebones i9 configuration.

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| CPU | Intel Core i9-13900H (14C/20T, up to 5.4GHz) |
| RAM | Up to 96GB DDR5-5600 (2x SODIMM) |
| Storage | 2x M.2 NVMe (PCIe 4.0) + 1x U.2 NVMe |
| Network | 2x 10GbE SFP+ + 2x 2.5GbE RJ45 |
| Expansion | PCIe 4.0 x16 slot (GPU capable) |
| Power | 15W idle / 80W load |
| Price | ~$700–900 USD barebones |

The MS-01 won on networking. Dual SFP+ ports mean I can run a dedicated 10GbE storage network without USB adapters or add-in cards — which matters when your NAS is serving NFS volumes to a Kubernetes cluster. The U.2 slot is a nice bonus for enterprise NVMe drives down the road, and the PCIe x16 slot keeps GPU passthrough as an option if I ever want to run local inference workloads.

The main alternative I considered was the **Minisforum MS-A2** — AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX with 16 cores and 32 threads, which handily beats the MS-01 on raw multi-threaded compute. But the MS-A2 lacks SFP+ (it uses 10GbE RJ45 instead, which is fine but would need 10G-T transceivers if your switch only has SFP+ ports) and has no PCIe expansion slot. For a build where I wanted networking flexibility, the MS-01 was the better fit.

<Callout type="tip">
If you're buying barebones mini PCs, start with 64GB RAM per node (2x 32GB DDR5 SODIMMs). It's enough for most homelab workloads and easy to upgrade to 96GB later. I went with **Crucial CT32G48C40S5** sticks at ~$65 each — reliable and widely compatible.
</Callout>

### What Three Nodes Gets You

With three MS-01s, the aggregate specs look like:

- **42 CPU cores** (14 per node), 60 threads
- **192GB RAM** (64GB per node)
- **6TB NVMe** local storage
- ~80W idle, ~300W under load

192GB of RAM across three nodes is, admittedly, a lot of headroom for what is currently running Pi-hole, a Grafana dashboard, and a handful of containers — but the capacity will come in useful one day, right? In the meantime, it's enough to run a 3-node HA k3s cluster, a Proxmox cluster with live migration, production PostgreSQL and Redis, Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, Home Assistant with full history retention, and small Ollama/LLM workloads — all simultaneously, without feeling cramped.

## Networking

### The Dual-Network Approach

I run two logically separate networks:

1. **Production network (2.5GbE)** — general traffic, management, API calls, everything that isn't bulk storage I/O
2. **Storage network (10GbE)** — dedicated path between the compute nodes and the NAS for NFS and backup traffic

This separation means a large backup job or a heavy database restore won't saturate the production network. The MS-01's dual SFP+ ports make this trivial — one SFP+ port per node goes to the storage side of the switch, and the 2.5GbE RJ45 ports handle everything else.

### Core Switch: TP-Link TL-SG3210XHP-M2

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Ports | 8x 2.5GbE PoE+ + 2x 10GbE SFP+ |
| Management | Full L2+, CLI, web UI |
| PoE Budget | 240W |
| Features | VLANs, LACP, QoS, IGMP, ACLs |
| Price | ~$300 USD |

The TP-Link handles both networks in a single chassis — the 2.5GbE PoE+ ports serve the production side (and power my access points and cameras), while the SFP+ uplinks connect to the nodes and NAS at 10GbE. At ~$300, it's a lot of switch for the money.

I use **10G SFP+ DAC cables** (1m, ~$15 each) for all 10GbE connections. DACs are cheaper than transceivers, have lower latency, and for same-rack runs they're more than sufficient.

<Callout type="info">
For cabling, I standardized on **Cat6a** everywhere. It supports 10GbE at the full 100m distance, handles PoE++ without issues, and runs about $0.25/ft in bulk. Cat5e would technically work for 2.5GbE, but Cat6a future-proofs the install. One thing to watch: always buy **solid copper** cable. Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) is cheaper but doesn't meet spec for PoE and degrades faster.

## Storage

### Local NVMe: Samsung 990 Pro 2TB

Each node has a **Samsung 990 Pro 2TB** as its primary local drive.

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Sequential Read | 7,450 MB/s |
| Sequential Write | 6,900 MB/s |
| IOPS (R/W) | 1.2M / 1.55M |
| Endurance | 1,200 TBW |
| Price | ~$150 USD |

The 990 Pro offers strong sustained performance and excellent random IOPS, which matters for database workloads and VM disk I/O. The **Crucial T500** at ~$120 was tempting as a value pick (and actually edges out the 990 Pro on sustained sequential writes), but the 990 Pro's higher random IOPS won out for my use case. Six terabytes of local NVMe across three nodes is plenty for OS, container images, and local databases.

### NAS: Synology DS923+

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Bays | 4 |
| CPU | AMD Ryzen R1600 |
| Max RAM | 32GB |
| Network | 2x 1GbE (10GbE expansion slot) |
| Price | ~$550 USD (NAS) + ~$100 (E10G22-T1-Mini 10GbE card) |

Synology's software ecosystem is what sold me — DSM is polished, the community support is deep, and the package library covers everything from Plex to Surveillance Station without much fuss. The DS923+ supports a 10GbE expansion card (the **E10G22-T1-Mini** at ~$100), which plugs directly into the storage network alongside the compute nodes.

I filled it with four **Seagate IronWolf 8TB** drives (~$150 each) in SHR-1 (Synology Hybrid RAID), which gives roughly 21TB usable storage with single-disk fault tolerance.

<Callout type="warning">
If you're buying NAS drives, make sure they're **CMR** (Conventional Magnetic Recording), not **SMR** (Shingled Magnetic Recording). SMR drives have significantly worse random write performance and can cause serious issues with RAID rebuilds. All the IronWolf and WD Red Plus/Pro drives are CMR — but double-check before buying, especially with lower-capacity models.
</Callout>

### Capacity Planning

For reference, the growth projections I used when sizing storage:

| Data Type | Initial | Monthly Growth | 3-Year Projection |
|-----------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| PostgreSQL | 100GB | 20GB | ~820GB |
| InfluxDB/TimescaleDB | 50GB | 10GB | ~410GB |
| Container images | 50GB | 5GB | ~230GB |
| Application logs | 20GB | 5GB | ~200GB |
| VM backups | 500GB | 50GB | ~2.3TB |

21TB of usable NAS storage gives me comfortable headroom for the next few years. If I outgrow it, the DS923+ supports a **DX517** 5-bay expansion unit (~$500) via eSATA.

## Power and Cooling

### UPS: CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Capacity | 1500VA / 1000W |
| Waveform | Pure sine wave |
| Runtime | ~12 min at 400W, ~25 min at 200W |
| Outlets | 12 (6 battery + 6 surge) |
| Interface | USB + Serial |
| Price | ~$230 USD |

The entire homelab idles at roughly 80W (three mini PCs, NAS, switch, router), which gives me around 25–30 minutes of UPS runtime on battery — more than enough to ride out a short outage or perform a graceful shutdown.

<Callout type="info">
**Why pure sine wave matters:** Mini PCs (and the NAS) use Active PFC power supplies, which expect a clean sine wave input. Stepped/simulated sine wave UPS units can cause these PSUs to shut down or behave erratically during a transfer to battery. The CyberPower PFC-series units are pure sine wave — worth the modest premium over their stepped-sine counterparts.
</Callout>

I monitor UPS status via **Network UPS Tools (NUT)**, which integrates cleanly with the CyberPower over USB. NUT handles automated shutdown signaling to the cluster nodes if the battery drops below a threshold — the configuration is straightforward but I won't reproduce it here.

### Singapore Heat and Humidity

Singapore's ambient humidity sits at 70–90% year-round, which is worth thinking about:

- Good ventilation is essential — don't enclose equipment in a sealed cabinet without airflow
- On cold-start after air conditioning has been off, watch for condensation on cold metal surfaces
- A utility room or storage closet works well; avoid the bomb shelter (no ventilation)

Fortunately, mini PCs run cool enough that active cooling beyond their built-in fans isn't necessary. The whole rack sits comfortably in a utility room without dedicated aircon.

## Rack Layout

The physical setup lives in an **ECHOGEAR 15U Open Frame** rack (~$150). Open-frame was a deliberate choice — it maximizes airflow (important in Singapore's climate) and makes cable management easier when you're working with mini PCs that don't have standard rack ears.

From top to bottom:

1. **Patch panel** — Cat6a keystone panel for structured cabling
2. **Core switch** — TP-Link TL-SG3210XHP-M2
3. **Compute shelf** — Three MS-01 units side by side on a rack shelf
4. **NAS shelf** — Synology DS923+
5. **UPS** — CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD at the bottom (heaviest item, lowest center of gravity)

Cable management is mostly DAC cables and short Cat6a patch cables between the shelf and the switch — keeping everything under 1m means the cable situation stays manageable without extensive velcro runs.

## Cost Breakdown

All prices are approximate and reflect what I paid at time of purchase. SGD pricing is included since I'm based in Singapore.

| Category | Item | Qty | Unit (USD) | Total (USD) | Total (SGD) |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Compute | Minisforum MS-01 i9 (barebones) | 3 | ~$750 | ~$2,250 | ~$3,600 |

| | | | **Total** | **~$5,140** | **~$7,570** |

<Callout type="tip">
If you're buying from Singapore, keep an eye on the **SGD $400 de minimis threshold** for GST. Orders under SGD $400 are exempt from the 9% GST. Where possible, splitting orders to stay under this threshold can save a meaningful amount — especially on the mini PCs, which are the single most expensive line item. Lazada and Shopee mega sales (11.11, Black Friday) typically knock 10–20% off as well.

## The True Cost of a Homelab

The hardware BOM above is the number you tell yourself (and your partner) when justifying the purchase. "It's a one-time investment," you say with confidence. It is not a one-time investment.

### Running Cost: Electricity

The homelab idles at ~80W and runs 24/7. Here's what that looks like on the power bill:

- **Monthly consumption**: 80W × 24h × 30 days = ~57.6 kWh
- **Monthly cost**: 57.6 kWh × SGD $0.29/kWh ≈ **SGD ~$17/month**
- **Annual cost**: **SGD ~$204/year**

At Singapore's current regulated tariff of about SGD $0.29/kWh (Q1 2026, inclusive of GST), the electricity cost is honestly pretty modest — less than a mid-tier Netflix subscription. The irony of spending SGD $7,500 on hardware and then agonizing over whether the MS-01 idles at 15W or 20W is not lost on me, but hey, that's the hobby.

Under load the picture changes — if the cluster is crunching at ~300W for extended periods, that's ~216 kWh/month or roughly SGD $63/month. But sustained full-load is rare in a homelab unless you're running LLM inference or Folding@Home. Most of the time, it's idle watts that matter.

### Hardware Replacement: The Cost Nobody Budgets For

Hardware doesn't last forever. Some components have fairly predictable lifespans:

| Component | Expected Lifespan | Replacement Cost | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| NAS HDDs (IronWolf 8TB) | 3–5 years | ~$150 each | Budget for 1–2 drive failures over 3 years |
| UPS battery | 2–3 years | ~$50–80 | CyberPower replacement batteries are readily available |
| NVMe drives (990 Pro 2TB) | 5+ years | ~$150 each | 1,200 TBW endurance is generous for homelab use |
| Mini PCs | 5–7 years | ~$750–900 each | More likely to be upgraded than to fail |

A realistic replacement budget is roughly **SGD $300–500/year** — mostly drives and UPS batteries. The NVMe drives should last well beyond their warranty period at homelab write volumes, and the mini PCs themselves will probably be replaced out of desire rather than necessity.

### 3-Year Total Cost of Ownership

| Cost Category | 3-Year Total (SGD) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Initial hardware | ~$7,570 |
| Electricity (3 years) | ~$612 |
| Replacements (drives, batteries) | ~$900–1,500 |
| **Total** | **~$9,100–9,700** |

So the "one-time" SGD $7,500 investment is really closer to SGD $9,000–10,000 over three years. Not exactly a rounding error, but spread over 36 months it works out to roughly SGD $250–270/month — or about what you'd pay for a modest cloud VM with far less compute. That's how I justify it, anyway.

## What I'd Change

A few things I'd reconsider if I were doing this again:

1. **The MS-A2 deserves a harder look now.** When I bought the MS-01s, the MS-A2 was either unavailable or priced at a premium. The 16-core Ryzen 9 would've given me meaningfully more compute headroom, and 10GbE RJ45 (versus SFP+) would've simplified cabling — no DACs needed, just standard Cat6a. The lack of a PCIe slot is the main thing that kept me on the MS-01.

2. **I underestimated NAS capacity.** 21TB usable seemed generous at the time, but VM backups and media accumulate faster than projected. A 5-bay DS1522+ (~$750) instead of the 4-bay DS923+ would've cost ~$200 more and given me an extra drive bay without needing an expansion unit later.

3. **A dedicated 10GbE storage switch might be worth it at scale.** Right now I'm using the SFP+ uplinks on the core switch for storage traffic, which works fine at three nodes. If I add more nodes, a dedicated **MikroTik CRS305-1G-4S+IN** (~$150, fanless, 8W) or the 8-port **CRS309-1G-8S+IN** (~$280) would give the storage fabric its own switch — cleaner separation and room to grow.

4. **Warranty matters more than I expected.** Minisforum's RMA process for Singapore means shipping to Hong Kong, which is inconvenient. If I were optimizing for peace of mind over features, the **ASUS NUC 14 Pro** with local ASUS Singapore service centers would be worth the premium — even though it only has a single built-in NIC.

None of these are regrets exactly — the build works well and has been reliable. But homelabs are iterative by nature, and there's always a next version to think about.
