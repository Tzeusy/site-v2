# Prompt: Write the Homelab Hardware Blog Post

## Task

Write the `index.mdx` blog post at `content/blog/2026-02-08-homelab-hardware/index.mdx`. The post documents the physical hardware that powers my homelab — compute nodes, networking gear, storage, power infrastructure, and rack layout.

## Source of Truth

Read every file in `/home/tze/homelab/docs/guides/hardware-implementations/`:

- `builds.md` — Pre-configured build tiers (Starter through Enterprise)
- `compute.md` — Mini PC and server recommendations
- `network.md` — Switches, routers, cabling, WiFi
- `power.md` — UPS, PDU, power monitoring
- `singapore.md` — Singapore-specific purchasing, retailers, pricing in SGD
- `storage.md` — NVMe drives, NAS systems, HDDs, capacity planning

These documents are the **single source of truth**. Do not fabricate specs, prices, model numbers, or capabilities. Every claim in the blog post must be directly traceable to these files.

## Critical Requirements

### 1. LLM-Generated Disclaimer

The post **must** open with a prominent disclaimer immediately after the frontmatter, before any other content. Use a `<Callout type="info">` block. The disclaimer should:

- State clearly that this post was generated by an LLM from a structured hardware reference document
- Explain that the author maintains the source-of-truth document and used an LLM to draft the prose
- Note that while the content has been reviewed, readers should verify specs and prices independently before purchasing

### 2. Zero Leakage of Sensitive Information

**Absolutely no** personal secrets, IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, usernames, passwords, API keys, physical addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information may appear in the post. The source docs may contain example configurations (e.g., NUT config with placeholder passwords) — do **not** reproduce these. When discussing network topology, use generic terms ("the NAS", "Node 1") rather than any real hostnames. Do **not** include the names of specific people (doctors, colleagues, vendor contacts, etc.).

### 3. Correctness Is Non-Negotiable

- Every hardware spec (CPU model, core count, RAM capacity, price, wattage) must exactly match the source documents
- Do not round, interpolate, or "improve" numbers — use them as-is
- If a spec is ambiguous or missing from the source, omit it rather than guess
- Prices are approximate and should be presented with `~` prefix as in the source docs
- Do not confuse models across tiers (e.g., don't attribute MS-A2 specs to the MS-01)

### 4. "Correct as of" Timestamp

The frontmatter should include a subtitle or the post should include a line immediately after the title indicating when the hardware information was last verified. Use the format:

> *Hardware inventory correct as of February 2026.*

This signals to readers that hardware and pricing evolve and the post reflects a point-in-time snapshot.

### 5. Writing Tone — Match the Rest of the Blog

Read the other posts under `content/blog/` to absorb the author's voice before writing. Key characteristics:

- **First-person, conversational but intellectually rigorous.** Not a product review site — this is a person writing about their own infrastructure decisions. Use "I", "my", "I've found that..."
- **Self-aware and measured.** Acknowledge tradeoffs honestly. Don't oversell choices. Phrases like "to some degree", "luckily for me", "funnily enough" are natural. Avoid marketing-speak or superlatives ("best-in-class", "game-changing").
- **Evidence-oriented.** Cite specific specs and numbers rather than vague claims. When making a recommendation, explain *why*.
- **Parenthetical asides for personality.** The author uses parenthetical humor and clarifications: "(why did they need like 3 IVs?)", "(I don't know, this still seemed a little high to me...)". Sprinkle these in naturally — don't force them.
- **Em dashes for secondary thoughts.** The author uses `—` liberally for interjections.
- **Wry, self-deprecating humor about the hobby.** The author is aware that a homelab is, at some level, an expensive indulgence. Lean into this with dry sarcasm and self-awareness:
  - **Cost guilt.** Joke about the total spend and the reactions of loved ones. The author's girlfriend is not entirely thrilled about the hardware budget — a parenthetical like "(my girlfriend's enthusiasm for this line item was… restrained)" or a wry aside about justifying yet another purchase is very on-brand. Don't overdo it — one or two cost-guilt beats across the whole post.
  - **Overprovisioning honesty.** The author knows these specs massively exceed current workloads. Acknowledge this openly with dry humor: "192GB of RAM across three nodes is, admittedly, a lot of headroom for what is currently running Pi-hole and a Grafana dashboard — but the capacity will come in useful one day, right?" The tone is self-aware, not defensive. The author is in on the joke.
  - **Electricity / power bill awareness.** A passing quip about idle wattage, the power bill, or the absurdity of caring about 15W idle differences when you're running 3 nodes 24/7 anyway.
  - **Keep it light and scattered.** These beats should feel like natural asides — a parenthetical here, an em-dash interjection there. Don't cluster them all in one section or turn the post into a comedy routine. The humor punctuates the technical content; it doesn't replace it.
- **No fluff.** Don't pad with filler sentences. Every paragraph should carry information or genuine reflection. Cut anything that reads like "In today's world of technology..." or "When it comes to homelab hardware...".
- **Lists for structured info.** The author breaks complex information into numbered or bulleted lists rather than burying it in prose.

### 6. MDX Components for Visual Variety

Use MDX components periodically to break up walls of text and add visual interest:

- `<Callout type="info">` — For factual asides, reference info, or "good to know" notes (e.g., explaining SHR-1 vs RAID, why pure sine wave matters for Active PFC PSUs)
- `<Callout type="tip">` — For practical advice or recommendations (e.g., "start with 64GB per node — easy to upgrade later")
- `<Callout type="warning">` — For gotchas or things to watch out for (e.g., "avoid SMR drives for NAS use", "soldered RAM means buy max upfront")

Aim for roughly one callout every 2–3 major sections. Don't overdo it — they should feel like natural pauses, not interruptions. The author's existing posts use them sparingly and deliberately.

Also use:

- **Tables** for spec comparisons (the source docs are full of these — adapt the best ones)
- **Bold text** for key product names or important terms on first mention
- Standard markdown images if relevant (though this post likely won't need many)

### 7. Frontmatter Format

Preserve the existing frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Homelab Hardware"
date: 2026-02-08
summary: "The physical hardware powering my homelab — from server selection to networking gear and rack layout."
tags: ["hardware", "homelab", "infra", "draft"]
---
```

**The frontmatter is considered static and must not be changed.** The title, date, summary, and tags have already been set by the author. Do not rewrite the title to be "cleverer", do not update the date to today's date, do not add or remove tags, and do not rephrase the summary. The only acceptable frontmatter modification is fixing an obvious typo — and even then, prefer leaving it alone. The frontmatter is not part of your creative scope; treat it as a fixed constraint.

## Suggested Structure

Use the existing skeleton in `index.mdx` as a starting point, but expand it into a full narrative:

1. **Disclaimer** (Callout — LLM-generated notice)
2. **Overview** — Brief intro: why I built a homelab, what tier/build I chose, and what this post covers. Reference the companion "Homelab Design" post for architecture/software decisions.
3. **Server Hardware** — Which mini PCs I selected and why. Cover the decision matrix (why MS-01 over alternatives, or whichever tier makes sense). Include a specs table.
4. **Networking** — Switches, 10GbE fabric, cabling choices. Explain the dual-network approach (production 2.5GbE + storage 10GbE) if applicable.
5. **Storage** — NVMe selection for local storage, NAS choice, HDD selection. Cover capacity planning briefly.
6. **Power and Cooling** — UPS sizing, why pure sine wave matters, NUT integration (without config details). Singapore humidity considerations.
7. **Rack Layout** — Physical arrangement, cable management.
8. **Cost Breakdown** — Total cost table. Include SGD pricing if relevant (the author is Singapore-based per the source docs). Acknowledge that prices are approximate and shift frequently.
9. **The True Cost of a Homelab** — A dedicated section breaking down three categories of cost that homelab builders rarely think about upfront:
   - **Initial (capital) cost.** The hardware BOM from the cost breakdown above. This is the obvious one.
   - **Running (operational) cost.** Electricity. Calculate the monthly and annual power bill based on the idle wattage from the source docs. Look up current Singapore electricity rates at runtime and use those to compute a realistic monthly figure. Factor in that the homelab runs 24/7. This is the cost most people underestimate.
   - **Hardware replacement / lifecycle cost.** HDDs have a 3–5 year expected lifespan. UPS batteries need replacement every 2–3 years. NVMe drives have endurance limits (TBW). Mini PCs themselves will eventually age out. Estimate what a rolling replacement cycle looks like — e.g., "budget ~$200–400/year for drive and battery replacements." This is the cost almost nobody budgets for.
   - Use a table or summary to make the total cost of ownership (TCO) over, say, 3 years tangible. This is a great place for wry humor about the gap between "it's just a one-time purchase" and reality.
10. **What I'd Change** — Brief reflection on lessons learned or what the author might do differently. This is where the self-aware, honest tone should shine.

You don't need to cover every single product from the source docs. Focus on what was *actually chosen* for the build, with brief mentions of alternatives considered. The source docs are a reference catalog — the blog post should tell the story of the decisions made.

**If the source docs don't make it clear which specific build/tier the author actually uses**, default to writing about the **Standard Build** tier as the primary focus, since it's marked as "Recommended for most homelabs" in `builds.md`. Mention other tiers as context (upgrade paths, etc.).

## Post-Writing

After writing the post, run two skills in sequence:

1. **`blogpost-formatter`** — Run first. This handles mechanical fixes: frontmatter normalization, MDX safety, asset hygiene (orphan detection, generic filename renames), and TODO/placeholder sweeps. Apply all auto-fixes it produces. These are deterministic, non-editorial changes that harden the post for build.

2. **`blogpost-editor`** — Run second, on the formatter's output. This performs the editorial review: structure, language quality, spelling, grammar, tone, and visual pacing. **Autonomously apply all critical and recommended fixes** without waiting for user confirmation. For subjective suggestions (tone, flow, visual pacing), use your best judgement — apply the ones that clearly improve the post, skip the ones that are stylistic preference.

Do not ask the user to review either report; just fix what needs fixing and note what you changed.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not invent hardware that isn't in the source documents
- Do not add affiliate links or tracking parameters to any URLs
- Do not write in a review/listicle style — this is a personal blog, not Tom's Hardware
- Do not include benchmark results unless they appear in the source docs
- Do not reproduce configuration file contents (NUT configs, etc.) — they may contain sensitive placeholders
- Do not mention specific people by name
- Do not pad the post to hit a word count — quality over quantity
