# Introduction

Mid-2021, when happily leveraging my company's sponsored annual full-health check-ups, one of my visits ended in awkwardness when the doctor conducting my Electrocardiogram said to me, "your heart sounds funny". Innumerable cardiologist conversations later, it has culminated in an eventual open-heart surgery conducted on 28 Jan 2026 in Mount Sinai.

I wanted to spend some time to go through the journey, in case it helps anyone feel better about their own journeys through similar troubles.
