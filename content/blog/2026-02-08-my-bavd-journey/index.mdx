# Introduction

Mid-2021, when happily leveraging my company's sponsored annual full-health check-ups, one of my visits ended in awkwardness when the doctor said "your heart sounds funny", along with some ominous pronouncements about how my medical insurance going forward is going to be way more expensive. Innumerable cardiologist conversations later, it culminated in an eventual open-heart surgery conducted at Mount Sinai.

I wanted to spend some time to go through the journey, in case it helps better inform anyone about their own journeys through similar troubles; and perhaps give myself a bit of a retroactive look at my journey many years on.

# The diagnosis

It began with a regular health check-up electrocardiogram in 2021; the cardiologist looked at it, noticed oddness, then chose to listen to my heart and noted a 'murmur'. A followup 2D-echocardiogram confirmed that the likely cause was Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease, with the cause of the 'wooshing' sound of my heart being the aortic regurgitation that was occurring with every pump.

The issue with bicuspid valves is that it's pretty hard to get definitive imagery on a component so deeply nested within the body; hence the use of echocardiograms, which are essentially ultrasounds pointed at the heart. 2D echocardiograms give us 2D 'cross-sections' of the heart, at a depth defined by the tool's controls; watching this cross-section over time allows one to 'see' the movement of the valve over the plane, and hence approximate the rough structure of said valve.

(TODO: add pictures)

# What is BAVD?

This is a gist gathered over my conversations with doctors, my research, and conversations with various LLMs. In a nutshell:

- Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease is a congenital condition where instead of the typical three-leaflet setup in my aortic valve ("tricuspid"), there are only two leaflets in mine

![BAVD summary, courtesy of Mayo Clinic](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/05/a-medical-illustration-of-a-normal-tricupid-aortic-valve-and-a-bicuspid-aortic-valve-which-is-a-contenital-defect-original.jpg)

- This leads to nontrivial amounts of **aortic regurgitation** - when the left ventricle 'pumps blood', some amount of it travels backwards, which can have several physiological downstream impacts:
    - The reduced blood flow can lead to the left ventricle enlarging over time ("LV dilation/remodeling"), as it 'gets stronger' to compensate for the reduced efficiency of each pump.
    - If the jet is eccentric (as mine was), it can cause micro-lesions within the heart.
    - Untreated, this can manifest in "shortness of breath, difficulty exercising, lightheadedness or chest pain.", culminating in possible heart failure after years of accumulated wear.

# Markers and follow-ups

With a bicuspid valve, there's no medicinal solution given that it's a structural issue with the heart; the only fixes possible are physical repair or replacements of the valve. According to my doctors, the aortic valve in particular is difficult to replace via catheter; the only recourse then is to perform **open heart surgery** (!!) to gain physical access to the valve itself. 

Open heart surgery is obviously one of the most drastic actions; it's as 'invasive' as it gets for a surgery.

<Callout type="info">
These were the two main guidelines I referred to in my research, guiding the following notes:
- [2025 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf194/8234488)
- [2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923)
</Callout>

Notwithstanding the severity of the surgery, the **remedies themselves** are not cure-all fixes. The options, as laid out by my Singaporean doctors, were both of *replacing* the valve entirely, with either of:

1. A mechanical valve, which would require me to take blood thinners (warfarin) for the rest of my life.
    - Mechanical valves, on the other hand, have a series of risks as well, with possible infections and complications with blood thinners making it essentially a 'lifelong-managed' condition, with still impacted reductions in life expectancy and quality-of-life.
2. A biological valve (usually a pig valve).
    - Biological valves were outright disqualified for me, as they tend to have durabilities of 7 to 10 years; given my age, the combination of this with the need for 'frequent' reinterventions (each subsequent surgery introduces higher risk) made it infeasible.

Given the drastic downsides of both options, cardiologists tend to advocate the delaying of conducting surgery as long as possible. They generally use thresholds on a few markers to guide their decision on whether or not to intervene:

- Ejection fraction: The estimated percentage of blood being successfully pumped with each contraction of the heart
- Left ventricular diameter exceeding a certain threshold

Given that my estimated regurgitation was 'mild-moderate' at the time of discovery (2021) and only progressing to 'moderate' up through 2024, I was content to manage the condition via periodic (6-month) followups with my cardiologist.

# Escalation

Unfortunately, there seemed to be notable progression in the rate of my regurgitation; having progressed from 'mild-moderate' in 2021 through to 'moderate' in 2024 and 'moderate-severe' in 2025, I got increasingly concerned about the condition. I'd consulted four different cardiologists in Singapore at this point, with the general consensus still being to delay as much as possible, given my EF and LV diameters still remaining within reasonable thresholds. 

On the side, though, I was watching other online sources (notably, [r/valvereplacement](https://www.reddit.com/r/valvereplacement)) on how others were handling similar conditions. This turned out to be influential. Some surgeons' names frequently surfaced as being world-renowned for their experience, with some centers being reputed for their high volume of treatments of similar conditions. This, along with a fortuitously timed work trip to New York City in September 2025, led to me scheduling a consult with Dr Ismail El-Hamamsy of Mount Sinai.

<Callout type="tip">
Side segue - it was vital that I managed to extract my past medical history in the form of both reports (pdfs) and 2D echocardiogram data (DICOM); this allowed me to share details on tests across four hospitals with relatively little friction.
</Callout>

The initial consult was very informative; he has dealt with many patients of my age and profile, and ultimately his perspective was similar (delay as long as possible, watch markers for thresholds). However, the measure he used differed from that of my Singaporean cardiologists; he preferred to use Left Ventricular *Volume* (normalized), rather than the diameter. This is harder to track, as this requires undergoing of an MRI rather than a 2D echo (to give a bit of a benchmark; MRIs cost ~3-5x more in Singapore). He also offered an additional set of operative alternatives to the valve replacements: Aortic valve *repair*, and the *Ross procedure*:

- Aortic valve repair involves repair of the existing valve with prosthetic material and a stent (TODO: word this a little more legibly). He estimated that statistically the durability of this would last about 20-25 years. 
    - The viability of this is subject to conditions he can only tell during the surgery itself; it involves feeling the pliability of the valve, suitability of the existing leaflets, etc.
- The Ross procedure involves replacing the aortic valve with the pulmonary valve, and replacing the pulmonary valve with that of a human cadaver's.
    - This is one of the most 'complex' options given the multiple steps and components involved.
    - Rough estimates of durability were about 15-20 years.
    - Also not a given; highly subject to feasibility of the pulmonary valve as a substitute for the aortic valve
    - Notably - Dr El-Hamamsy is world-renowned for this procedure, with Mt. Sinai being one of the highest volume centers in the world
- If both the Repair and the Ross are infeasible, to fall back to a mechanical ON-X valve.

Given the short-term nature of my visit, he sent me for an expedited MRI in Mt Sinai, which discovered that my left ventricular volume exceeded his thresholds by ~20%. In a hastily arranged subsequent MRI-review consult, he essentially suggested that the best way to optimize for lifespan and an active lifestyle was to intervene within the next 6 months, to give the left ventricle the best chance to remodel.

All in all, his laid-out plan for me with the goal of me being able to blow my 90th birthday candle was:

1. Repair of the valve, if possible (best case scenario)
2. When the repair begins to fail OR the repair is deemed infeasible, conduct a Ross
3. When the Ross fails, follow up with prosthetic or biological valves

This would require leaving a fair amount of trust to his subjective intra-operative decision making; I'd be going into surgery without a clear idea of the eventual decision made. Of note, however, was his confidence in the operation; maybe because of his experience (he's done ~1300+ similar operations), he was very confident in the chance of success, with an estimated lethality risk of &lt;0.5% (I don't know, this still seemed a little high to me, but I don't have a bayesian anchor for this number...) and a reasonably high estimation that a repair was possible based on the existing imagery he had. This dispelled to some degree my instinctive apprehension over the 'severity' of an *open heart surgery*.

# The Dilemma 

This left me with a bit of a dilemma; Singaporean and American opinions significantly diverged on both my *operative options* as well as *surgical timeline recommendations*. 

I had several followup appointments with cardiologists in Singapore; even a Ross specialist in Singapore (sadly, Singapore is a much smaller-volume center, but I felt it was good to get as many views as possible). The general consensus was:
- Mt Sinai is a highly reputable center for heart surgeries; one even congratulated me and shook my hand (probably a little tongue-in-cheek?)
- The cost is exorbitant compared to one in Singapore; honestly it was only possible because of my extremely generous company insurance coverage.
- Their general recommendation is still to *delay* given that they are following existing established guidelines; but they acknowledge the experience/credibility of the alternative opinions.

{/* TODO: Lay out an empty markdown table with columns Credibility/Risk/Lifestyle impact/Longevity and rows Singapore (Delay, mechanical valve) and NYC (Operate, Repair/Ross) */}

I eventually decided to go ahead with Dr El-Hamamsy's recommendation, as:

1. My opportunity to do the operation in NYC is limited to the period during which I have generous healthcare coverage; nothing's to say this will remain true 10 years later.
1. Ross procedure statistics have shown [similar-to-general-population life expectancies](https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/clinical/cardiac-surgery/long-term-data-highlight-ross-procedures-safety-effectiveness-younger-patients#:~:text=The%20new%20long%2Dterm%20data,%2C%22%20El%2DHamamsy%20explained.) (though with a pinch of salt - Dr El-Hamamsy authored this paper)
1. Intuitively, I generally agreed with the instinct for preventative measures, to intervene while there is a good chance the heart can remodel to safe thresholds.
1. My regurgitation progressed relatively significantly in 2025 (mild-moderate -> moderate -> moderate-severe -> 'basically severe') over a series of 4 echos/MRIs
1. Based on existing echocardiogram imagery, Dr El-Hamamsy was reasonably confident a repair was possible.

# The Surgery

## Pre-operative checks

I flew into NYC on 24th January with my parents and partner, checking into a hotel selected mostly with distance-to-hospital and availability-of-gyms in mind. We had a pre-consult with Dr El-Hamamsy and his team to get pre-clearance for surgery; there were prerequisites like blood tests, a chest X-Ray, screenings for Staphylococcus in my nose, and the like. It was also a good chance for my family to meet the surgeon who'd be operating on their son. I'd like to think this did plenty to help assuage their concerns as well; Dr El-Hamamsy even recommended that they go watch a show during the operation instead of worrying around outside (I'm glad they eventually followed his advice! They said MJ was pretty good, though they were interrupted halfway by a phone call indicating the surgery's success).

## Surgery Day

We headed in at 8am and had a nice long brief on the procedure and forms; I had something like 5 different holes poked in me for various things like IVs (why did they need like 3 IVs?), blood tests, and so forth. After saying farewell to my family, they brought me to a 'general ward?' where different parts of the surgical team introduced themselves to me over time (several anaesthesiologists and nurses, as well as doctors on Dr El-Hamamsy's team). After about an hour of this (and some forms signed), they wheeled me into the operative room, which (to no surprise, I suppose) looked just like any other medical show's operating rooms, with blazingly bright lights and people decked out in scrubs behind complex-looking equipment.

General anaesthesia is really a work of modern magic; it's my second time having undergone this. I barely remember five minutes of being in the operating room itself, with the (very nice) anaesthesiologist conversing with me till unconsciousness. The next thing I knew, I was barely groggily awake, with a dull ache in my chest, and my girlfriend giving me news about my company's CTO leaving (?). Thought I was dreaming, but nope, that's just how life works. That, along with me insistently asking about the result of the surgery (remember - I had no idea of the eventual surgical option going into the op), is all I remember of the surgery and the immediate aftermath. I was told I had a breathing tube put in, but thankfully I only woke from the surgery after the tube was removed.

Happily for me, the surgery turned out to have gone very well; there were no unexpected hiccups, the repair was deemed feasible, and the operation completed faster than the usually expected 4-6 hours. It seemed the stars aligned for this, which is honestly as much as I could've asked for, and I say this with no small amount of gratefulness to Dr El-Hamamsy's excellent team :).

<Callout type="info">
Some details on the surgery itself; easier conveyed through Dr El-Hamamsy's full operative notes:
> General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. A median sternotomy was performed. The pericardium was opened. Heparin was administered and the cannulas were inserted. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated. The aorta was clamped and transected and cold Del Nido cardioplegia was administered selectively through the coronary ostia.
>
> The aortic valve was examined. It was a bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left cusps. The commissures are positioned at about 130 degrees. There is significant prolapse of the fused right and left cusps. Nevertheless, all parts of the aortic valve are not calcified with no thickening or retraction or fenestrations or calcifications. As a result, structurally, the valve was very amenable to repair; however, the commissural angle makes it such that in order to obtain a durable repair, repositioning of the commissures would be more favorable. Therefore, the decision was made to perform a valve-sparing root replacement along with the bicuspid valve repair.
>
> Both ostia were mobilized in usual fashion. The sinuses of Valsalva were resected leaving about 3 mm attached to the hinge point of the leaflets. Deep dissection was performed around the aortic root all the way down to the level of the basal ring. 9 pledgeted 2-0 Ethibond sutures were passed along a horizontal plane from inside the LVOT to the outside of the aortic root in mattress fashion along the horizontal plane corresponding to the basal ring. The sutures will be used for the extra-aortic annuloplasty ring. Importantly, these sutures were placed in an asymmetric fashion in order to further reduce the muscular portion of the LVOT rather than the fibrous portion to restore the commissural angle.
>
> Next, we shifted our attention to the aortic valve itself. The raphe was cut and mobilized in order to lower the insertion point of the fused cusp and increased the geometric height. Thinning of the line of the raphe was completed. The free edge of the fused cusp was then remodelled using single interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures to reduce the length of the free margin and correct the prolapse. A total of 5 sutures were used to achieve this goal. At this point, both leaflets seemed to coapt very nicely and the effective heights looked very adequate.
>
> We next selected a 28 mm Hemashield graft and cut it into 2 tongues at 200 and 160 degrees. This will mobilize the commissures in a more symmetrical fashion. Remodeling of the aortic root was then completed using a running 5-0 Prolene suture. The valve was examined inside the graft and looked very satisfactory.
>
> A 30 mm Dacron ring was then selected for the annuloplasty. The ring was lowered into position and all sutures were tied. This reduced the aortic annulus, which was originally measured at 32 mm in an asymmetric fashion corresponding to the angles of the commissures at the top.
>
> Next, both coronary ostia were reimplanted within their respective sinuses and the Dacron graft was anastomosed to the native ascending aorta.
>
> De-airing was completed. The cross-clamp was removed. The heart regained spontaneous sinus rhythm with good biventricular function. The patient was easily weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass. Echocardiographic analysis showed excellent valve-ventricular function. Hemostasis was secured. Protamine was administered. All cannulas were safely removed. A temporary pacemaker wire and mediastinal chest tube were left in place. The pericardium was reapproximated. The sternum and skin were closed in usual fashion and the patient was extubated on the table and transferred to the ICU in stable hemodynamic condition.
>
> Of note, after exploring the aortic valve and while determining whether or not to repair the pulmonary valve was explored by transecting the distal pulmonary artery. The pulmonary valve is perfectly intact with no fenestrations and can be used very effectively for a Ross procedure in the future should that be necessary.

*TL;DR: They cut my chest, broke my sternum, cut open my heart, found the problem, and repaired my valve (yay!) with some synthetic material (Hemashield graft, Dacron ring). Then they stitched everything together, even my sternum (with titanium wires)*
</Callout>

# Recovery

The general timeline for the recovery from an open heart surgery tends to span three months, and my experience so far has tallied with that; going into details...

## Hospitalization

Hospitalization started with one day in the ICU, and 4-6 days in a 'cardiac step-down ward' after. The staff were fantastic throughout, with good care and surprisingly good food; I quite enjoyed the hospitality of Mt Sinai's GP-7 West ward. 

I emerged from the surgery with a few lingering... attachments? A chest tube, a catheter, a 24/7-on HR monitor (for vitals alerting, I'd presume), and an IV drip. The chest tube was plugged directly into my chest (below the incision). That aside, there were a few major pains to recover from:

- My sternum, having been broken and stitched back together, has to fuse back together
- All the various muscles in my chest that were cut have to heal
- Everywhere I was poked with a needle (most notably my neck) also had to heal
- My lungs couldn't expand fully on account of all of the above chest damage
- Significantly reduced stamina on account of the above

Chronologically, my experiences:

- The evening of Day 0 was the worst, by far; though the operation itself completed early-afternoon, I only came to in the evening, flitting in and out of consciousness. My first memory is of feeling *severe* dehydration, frequently asking for water (and I'm told ice chips, though I don't remember this part).
    - This unfortunately spectacularly backfired with several bouts of severe nausea, which is apparently a common side-effect of anaesthesia. This led to me vomiting or dry-heaving several times over the night, which felt like hell combined with the pain in my chest.
    - I remember thinking this was one of the longest nights of my life, on account of the parched-ness, the dry-heaving, and the feeling of fear-of-drinking-for-fear-of-puking. I had a mini-anxiety attack at some stage, which was really strange as I've never had that 'impending sense of doom' feeling before.
    - In the ICU, nurses were allocated to patients at a 1:1 ratio; I was really thankful for this, as I'm sure I was a handful over the entire night with my periodic struggles. Jaslyn (Jazlene? Don't know the spelling) was a constant reassuring presence, wiping me down and providing me consolations on how it would all blow over soon.
- Days 1-2 were a slow-burn of 5-6/10 pain; this was the first time in my life I noted the efficacy of painkillers on myself (I'd taken Panadols before, but more on doctor's advice rather than marked observation of effects on my body).
    - Admittedly, the painkiller they administered was oxycodone (TODO: research link here), which is pretty high on the opioid level, on the same level of morphine. No wonder I felt obvious relief from it.
    - I was also given an Incentive Spirometer (TODO: link here) and advised to train on it 5-10 times an hour. While somewhat discouraging at first, it really helped in the end to give me an idea of the recovery progress of my lungs. Day 0: 300mL
    - The feeling of having a catheter attached is *very interesting* -  throughout the entire period, I had no urges to pee at all, and liquid simply naturally dripped (or it was sucked?) its way into the catheter container.
- On Day 3 (I think?), the catheter and the incision patch were removed, allowing me to see my incision for the first time; a mess of stitches and glue, that I was strongly advised to avoid disturbing.
    - Day 3 is when I began trying to physically walk; my first time was with the help of a physical therapist, we did a round around the ward and I noted the very odd dichotomy of exhaustion in the chest while feeling perfectly fine in the legs.
    - Walking around was pretty annoying, because you essentially need to carry around all the attached equipment with you while walking (chest tube fluid drainage tank, IVs if any, live HR monitor, and catheter drain tank). However, walking is apparently one of the best ways to speed up recovery (according to ChatGPT)
- On Day 4, the chest tube was removed (yay!). Online research implied this is usually the turning point of pain, though to be honest I didn't notice any major uptick in quality-of-life; the chest tube incision still hurt, though maybe got aggravated less from not having something shifting around.
- On Day 5, I was able to walk laps around the ward without much difficulty, and was down to an averaged-out 2-3/10 level of pain (rather bursty in nature). However, doctors noted some elevated liver enzyme numbers, so decided to hold me till day 6 before discharge
    - On Day 5, I had a bout of runny-nose induced coughs, which was *really harsh* on the chest, causing spikes of intense pain (and a desperate instinct to hold in my coughs). This went on to plague me over the next 10 days, surfacing on-and-off, notably correlated with physical fatigue and mild throat irritants (notably, milo powder and tiramisu powder...).
- Day 6: Discharge! Day 6 was also the first day I could shower myself, leaving me feeling clean and ready to move on.

## Post-discharge (NYC)

I was discharged on 4 Feb, and spent the ensuing 12 days more or less ensconced in my hotel room in NYC. Luckily, we had the foresight to upgrade to a suite room (so a living room + bedroom) with accessibility features, so a lot of accommodations worked out in our favor:
- Handholds in the bathroom for stability
- Ample space (suited for wheelchairs presumably)
- Pretty good temperature control
- Close proximity to the elevator

I was also instructed to keep track of several metrics over time:

- Blood pressure: Targeting systolic BP of <110 mmHg
- Temperature: Watching out for fevers
- Heart Rate
- Weight: Watching out for sudden weight gain (for fluid retention)

I was also given a medley of medicines to manage these, along with pain medication for lingering pains (which were generally ever-present).

Some thoughts on this period:
- I found it pretty hard to get continuous stretches of sleep, on account of the numerous aches across my chest; I found that there was no 'stable bed position' in which I could comfortably lie for over 3-4 hours, with whichever load-bearing part of the chest feeling increasingly sore over time.
- Sleeping on my back was basically a must up through Day 14; on Day 14, I found I could (periodically, for short bursts) lie on my side to ease the accumulated ache from lying on my back
- Sitting up from a lying position was *really tough*, given the constraints (no arm-lifting of >4kg), especially because our hotel bed was too damn soft (normally a good thing...)
- My spirometer 'performance' grew; the doctor's given benchmark was 1000mL, and I was able to hit 2500mL by day 15, with an original shameful display of 300mL on Day 1.

We had a post-discharge review on day 13, during which doctors noted good recovery and generally good numbers on my blood tests, giving me clearance to fly back.

### Helpful and unhelpful factors

What I found really helped in my recovery:

1. A wedge pillow, which allowed me to 'sit up' for long periods of time with periodic angle and pillow-height adjustments. This also initially helped with sleeping, but by day ~10 I found the rigidity was starting to cause more discomfort than help so I started sleeping flat (with elevated pillows where possible).
1. Lots and lots of UberEats (or loved-ones-taking-away-food) deliveries to cut on the exhausting journeys outside of the hotel in subzero temperatures
    - Same for laundry - lucky me!
1. Amazon - shopping distractions from pain aside, we could easily get lots of snacks and furniture/cutlery for our three-week stay off a one-month Prime membership. We even managed to get a refund for our (unused) shower chair!
1. A lovely heart-pillow they gave me on Day 0 that accompanied me through my worst times; explicit instructions were to clutch it close to my chest during coughs to spread the impact across the entire chest rather than risk hurting the sternum's recovery. I suppose any chest-sized pillow would help here
1. An easily accessible gym, where I began with staggered 15-minute walks and ended with regular 30+ minute 'faster-but-not-brisk-yet' walks near the end
    - This tended to correlate with uncomfortable evenings of runny noses/coughing struggles, though, so sadly I wasn't as dedicated to these as I'd initially wanted
1. Claude Max and Codex subscriptions kept my mind occupied, rewriting my [personal website](https://github.com/Tzeusy/site-v2) and entirely vibe-coding a play-idea I was inspired by, which was to have my own personal [butler](https://github.com/Tzeusy/butlers/).
    - Learning the current SOTA of agentic development, and using the latest models (Opus 4.6/Codex 5.3) led me to believe models have just surpassed a cliff of usability for software engineering purposes; more to follow in other blog posts...
1. A weighing scale, Blood Pressure monitor, and thermometer (I'd brought the latter two; we had to buy the weighing scale)

Not so helpful was...

1. A shower chair, which others had suggested online; we had bought one, but it turned out that I could shower myself just fine from Day 6, so we ended up never using it. Probably much more helpful for older patients, who struggle with dexterity or with remaining standing while showering?
1. Ibuprofen, which might have had *some* effect but really paled in comparison to oxycodone (after the oxycodone prescription ended). I wound up generally taking this every night in the (sometimes validated) hope that it would stymie my pain enough to give me a full night of sleep.
    - I was advised against taking Paracetamol as my liver numbers were still slightly elevated, so no ideas on the efficacy there
1. My second (portable) monitor which I'd brought hoping to set up a workstation; the desk setup wasn't optimal, and moving my neck turned out to be a little more uncomfortable than necessary

# Flight back to Singapore

Luckily for me, my loved ones accompanied me on this trip; as a result, we didn't have to risk my interaction with heavy weights (luggage, carry-ons, etc.) as they helped to shoulder my burden. 

As to the flight itself, no news here :-) I wrote this part on the plane!

# Going forward

## Dental Health

Funnily enough, dental health is one of the major concerns going forward for the rest of my life. Infective endocarditis is a possible downstream complication with bicuspid valves and repairs/replacements. Things like antibiotic prophylaxis and daily flossing are now things constantly in the back of my mind whenever it comes to worrying about my teeth.

## Subsequent Ross/Valve

I now have an impending spectre of a potential valve replacement, hopefully more than 20 years down the line. This will be managed with annual 2D echocardiograms in Singapore to track LV size and regurgitation; I'm holding out some small hope that technological innovations grow in the interim to give me more surgical options, and also that we get even more data on the Ross such that it becomes a more globally standardized and accepted form of treatment for my condition.

Ultimately, I've accepted (or well, have accepted from the start) that there's no cure-all solution, and that the most important step to take is always simply the next step: Ask what is the best course of action to take now, given the information I know, the data I have, and the advice I've received. Many have wondered why my attitude towards the impending surgery almost seemed blase; that's really because I was fairly confident that, at any point of time during my management of my condition, I'd already done everything I could and already received world-class advice on steps to take. 

I suppose it's part of the philosophy of my life - no regrets and no fears, as long as all options have been explored and we've made the best possible decision :). To anyone who might be reading this in a similar situation, I hope this was informative and helpful in some way; and to anyone who might be reading this in the future, I hope this was an interesting divergent read, in a blog that's normally about technical and geeky things!
