# What is a golink?

I was setting up tailscale within my cluster when I stumbled upon what seemed to be a mini side project - https://github.com/tailscale/golink. After reading into it for a minute, I was sold; having seen similar examples before, I loved the idea that this was possible for my own homelab. And it is!

Within an hour of exploration, I got this up and running in my Kubernetes cluster (running ghcr.io/tailscale/golink); with the magic of MagicDNS, http://go/ within my tailnet became a trivial way to shortcut any link I wanted!

Now I can access any link with a trivial `'go/...'` on any machine within my tailnet :-)
