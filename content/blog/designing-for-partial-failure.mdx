## Assume One Dependency Is Down

Most incidents are not total outages. They are partial failures where one
critical dependency goes brown while everything else keeps serving traffic.

In a healthy system, every service responds within SLA and the gateway routes
normally:

When one dependency degrades, the blast radius depends entirely on how you
designed for it. Without upfront planning, one brown service cascades into a full
outage:

  />
  <figcaption>The Orders service is down, but Auth and reads still work — if the gateway knows how to degrade gracefully.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Define Degraded Modes Early

Write degraded behavior in advance:

- What still works
- What is delayed
- What is blocked

## Favor Honest Interfaces

When a dependency is degraded, surface that state clearly. Quietly timing out
and retrying forever creates mystery, not resilience.
