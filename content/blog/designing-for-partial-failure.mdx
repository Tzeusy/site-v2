## Assume One Dependency Is Down

Most incidents are not total outages. They are partial failures where one
critical dependency goes brown while everything else keeps serving traffic.

## Define Degraded Modes Early

Write degraded behavior in advance:

- What still works
- What is delayed
- What is blocked

## Favor Honest Interfaces

When a dependency is degraded, surface that state clearly. Quietly timing out
and retrying forever creates mystery, not resilience.
