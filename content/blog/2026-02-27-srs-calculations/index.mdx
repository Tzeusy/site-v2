# What is SRS?

The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a voluntary, tax-deferred savings program in Singapore designed to help individuals build retirement funds alongside their CPF. Contributions allow for dollar-for-dollar tax relief (up to S$15,300/year for Singaporeans/PRs; S$35,700/year for foreigners). Funds can be invested in various instruments, with 50% of withdrawals during retirement tax-free.

Back in 2024 I had a mini debate with a family member over how valuable it is to put savings in the SRS, given different (current) tax brackets. The SRS is effectively a tax deferment program; instead of paying 100% of taxes on (up to $15.3k) of your income today, you pay it *upon withdrawal after retirement age*, with the added bonus that only 50% of the withdrawn amount is subject to income tax (which, given Singapore's progressive tax model, works out to a larger cut in effective tax paid).

It sounds fine and dandy; however, there are a few major caveats:

- Your SRS funds become effectively illiquid; in the circumstances that you want to withdraw early, you have to pay a 5% fee, as well as 100% of the tax rate on the withdrawn sum (where, if you're still working, means you're paying the marginal tax rate of SRS *after* factoring in your income).
- After hitting retirement age, you must withdraw all SRS savings within the ensuing 10 years (for the purposes of 'breaking it up' across assessable-income years, that means you have to spread your SRS withdrawals out over 11 years to minimize the tax burden)
- SRS funds earn a baseline annual interest rate of 0.05% if left as cash in your SRS account, but certain platforms can be used where you can choose from a few SRS-vetted higher-risk portfolios (e.g. unleveraged all-equities funds with Roboadvisors like Endowus/Stashaway)

![Endowus SRS page](endowus.png)

This leads us to a few questions:

1. How much do I value the liquidity of $15,300 per year?
2. What is the effective opportunity cost of funds invested in SRS, versus funds invested in my personal savings strategies sans. SRS?

Question 1 is relatively straightforward to answer; it'll equate to a rough liquidity loss of $1,275 per month, locked up until retirement age. Question 2, however, is quite multifaceted, with a large variety of factors depending on market conditions, personal risk appetite, tax regimes, so on and so forth.

*Disclaimer: I use Endowus throughout this analysis as it's the cheapest platform I could find with access to 100% global equity ETF funds for SRS. If a lower-fee alternative exists, the numbers may shift in SRS's favor.*

| Platform | Type | All-in fee (p.a.) | 100% Global Equity? |
|---|---|---|---|
| POEMS / FSMOne (SGX ETFs) | DIY brokerage | ~0.03-0.20% | Limited (SGX-listed only) |
| Endowus Fund Smart (single fund) | Managed | ~0.40% (0.30% + ~0.10% fund) | Yes |
| FSMOne (unit trusts) | Fund platform | ~0.45% | Yes |
| Syfe Core Equity100 | Robo | ~0.55-0.85% (0.35-0.65% tiered + ~0.20% fund) | Yes |
| StashAway | Robo | ~0.35-0.95% (0.20-0.80% tiered + ~0.15% fund) | Yes |

*Syfe and StashAway fees are tiered by AUM. An SRS fund growing from $15k to ~$1.9M moves through multiple tiers over its lifetime. At peak SRS balances ($1M+), Syfe drops to 0.35% platform and StashAway to 0.20% platform.*

# Baseline Investment Numbers

A long-time-horizon investment plan with a 100% equity portfolio on Endowus is projected to grow at 7.69% per year. For the sake of comparison, we shall also use this as our *external* investment strategy.

![Endowus rolling returns projections](endowus-projections.png)

Externally we invest in VWRA (FTSE All-World index) and SPY (S&P 500) - per these numbers from [Curvo](https://curvo.eu/backtest/en/compare?portfolios=NoIgag6gwgoiA0xQEkYAY0CEDSBWTAigCoAcaCAjALo1A%2C%20NoIgygZACgBArABgSANMUBJAokgQgZgA1CAlKBATlQEYBdeoA), both outperform 7.69%:

![VWCE (also FTSE all-world) and SPY, net of fees per Curvo](vwce-spy.png)

To normalize risk and returns for a fair comparison, let's say we use 7.69% for both for-SRS and ex-SRS strategies. I like to model these as *cash flows* - for each year, calculate the amount of funds invested, taxes paid, etc., and simply model the net sum at the end. Importantly, Endowus charges a **0.4% per-annum management fee** on top of underlying funds' expense ratios - this means that our effective interest rates are:

| Strategy | Details |
|---|---|
| Endowus | 1.0769 × 0.996 = 1.07256, or 7.256% |
| External investment | 7.69% |

Tax is calculated using Singapore's progressive income tax brackets (YA2025). Since the $15,300 SRS deduction comes off the top of your income, the tax savings occur at your **marginal rate** (18% at $200k, rising to 22% as income grows), not the effective rate.

Given my calculations, the numbers are surprisingly close. Given a starting income of $200k, we can see that *at almost no point in our life does SRS give us 'more money' than personally investing the funds* — the SRS profile only overtakes no-SRS by a razor-thin margin of **$1,485** in the very last year of withdrawal, on a ~$67M portfolio:

![Liquidity Comparison](srs-vs-no-srs-line.png)

The general idea of SRS is that your 'accumulated liquidity' improves due to the tax deferment - you sacrifice early-age liquidity for lower taxes on the same funds in future. You would expect the SRS profile to 'overtake' the no-SRS profile during the withdrawal period as the tax savings come home. It technically does — but the gap peaks at **-$1.7M** at age 62 and only barely crosses zero at the very end:

![Liquidity Difference](liquidity-difference.png)

# Confounding factors

There are several factors that may change our calculations going into the future:

| Factor | Impact |
|---|---|
| Tax Regime | If income tax is higher in future, SRS strategy *devalues* (pay more EIR tomorrow than EIR today) |
| Lower-fee vendors | If any cheaper alternative to Endowus shows up (&lt;0.4% fees), SRS strategy improves |
| Retirement Age | Irrelevant to me as the SRS Retirement age is fixed at time of first deposit; but for future new-adults, your accumulated sums may be different |
| Investment Strategy | It's generally advisable to migrate to less-risky portfolios as you age; e.g. a [three fund portfolio](https://curvo.eu/backtest/en/portfolio/three-fund--NoIgKgFgTgpjAEAzArgOwCYgDTFASQFEAGIgIQBYBGAJQE0AZANgGZsiA6Z8gXRxEJKlmADWHUACkQCcbTs175iZAGLlqygBLNKs5gCYpho8eONu5oA). However, this impacts both Endowus- and external investment strategies roughly equivalently. |

# Why is the system broken?

There are a few frictions that cause the majority of differences between our numbers:

1. The *Endowus 0.4% annual fee* adds significant compounded erosion. The SRS tax arbitrage is real — you save at your 18-22% marginal rate during accumulation and pay back at only ~3.76% effective during withdrawal (thanks to the 50% concession + progressive rates on a smaller base). This should be worth ~$720k over a lifetime. But the 0.4% annual fee compounds to erode almost exactly that amount, leaving SRS essentially breakeven. If we simply made the Endowus fee 0% (i.e. if there was some way to get equivalent outside rate of return to inside), SRS would win by ~$720k:

![Endowus fee impact on SRS returns](endowus-fees.png)

![If Endowus had no fees](liquidity-difference-endowus-no-fees.png)

2. The 10-year cap on SRS withdrawals forces a compressed withdrawal schedule. By age 62, our SRS sum has compounded into $2,094,824.37; an even withdrawal strategy over 11 years requires -$268,388 per year (after taking into account compounding). After the 50% taxable amount haircut, this amounts to a 'taxable income' of ~$134k, or ~3.76% effective tax on the full withdrawal. This is actually quite favorable — the real issue is that a longer withdrawal period would let the remaining SRS balance compound further while keeping each withdrawal's taxable portion in lower brackets.
    - Note that SRS also introduces significant risk in the form of tax regimes. If Singapore tweaks the tax brackets in future (as we already have seen in [2024](https://www.iras.gov.sg/docs/default-source/budget-2022/budget-2022---overview-of-tax-changes69937d71-ba59-4b39-b1e5-7e85b2504e1c.pdf?sfvrsn=8339ba5a_5#:~:text=Effective%201%20Jan%202024&text=Enhance%20the%20progressivity%20of%20property%20tax%20for%20non%2Downer%2D%20occupied,two%20years%20as%20shown%20below.)), we would be subjecting our SRS deposits to whatever rates the government sets in future.

# Conclusion: Should I invest in SRS?

If you're savvy enough to invest yourself, with the profile above it's hard to see a compelling argument for investing in SRS. The tax arbitrage is real (save at 18-22% marginal, pay back at ~3.76% effective), but the fee erosion from SRS platforms almost exactly cancels it out, leaving you essentially breakeven against self-directed investment on platforms like IBKR. Going with SRS + Roboadvisor, we see:

1. Significantly reduced choices for investment funds
2. Annual percentage-based fee erosion of capital (0.3% to 0.4%)
3. Significant liquidity lockup
4. Risk in tax regime

And in return, we maybe see a *tiny* amount of net-cash-growth in the last few years of our SRS withdrawal period.

- With a 0.4% fee platform: roughly breakeven (the tax arbitrage and the fee erosion almost exactly cancel each other out)
- With a lower-fee platform: SRS wins
- With a higher-fee platform (>0.66%): SRS loses
- The liquidity lockup is the real unmodeled cost that tips the scale

## Side Note - Why do my numbers contradict common wisdom??

When I first got these results I was quite surprised, as general sentiment online has been largely in favor of investing in SRS; [a recent post last month](https://old.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1q0d2fz/debunking_the_myth_can_you_lose_money_investing/), for example, recommends 'if you are a HENRY (>$100k per year) it is always optimal to start contributing to SRS and investing it as early as possible'.

However, I downloaded his spreadsheet and noted a few factors:

1. In his own words, *it doesn't make sense to invest in SRS at all ages - there's a curve of an 'ideal age' to start investing in SRS*. My projections are specifically for 30 year olds. The author finds that it starts becoming profitable at age 34, for $200k income and 7.69% interest rate.
2. No platform fee erosion (assumes 7% both in and outside of SRS) - **this explains the main difference in recommendations**

Having taken these factors into account, I decided I won't be following the SRS scheme, given the significant downsides and negligible upside.
