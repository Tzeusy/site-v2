# Preamble

I'm often frustrated when, after having worked for days or weeks on a project, they get lost to the slow obseleting march of progress of the outer world. While knowledge for knowledge's sake is important and all, *some* knowledge has long term applicability and others simply exists as a novelty after having exhausted its golden age of usefulness.

Take, for example, calculation. People used to have all sorts of complex schemes to help with calculation; the best calculators used to base their careers around slide rules, logarithm tables, and abacuses. Nowadays, calculators are so ubiquitous that the need to even learn how to do basic arithmetic is fading away; most people just reach for their phones or computers to do the calculations for them. While those skills still exist, their relevance to today's challenges and problems is much diminished, perhaps only being useful for specific niches of mental math or trivia games.

I see this everywhere, even on topics immediately relevant to me:
- Some applications at work are based on Apache fcgi, a technology that was popular in the late 90s and early 2000s but has since been largely replaced by more modern web application frameworks. While there are still some legacy systems that use fcgi, it's not a technology that's widely used or relevant in today's web development landscape. Mastering this skill only serves to make me a better maintainer of legacy code, but doesn't really help me build new applications or understand modern web development practices.
