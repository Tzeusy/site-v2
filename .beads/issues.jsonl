Slightly academic but modern.\nThink: a personal column in a serious magazine written by an engineer.\nThe design disappears so the content feels deliberate and trustworthy.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Next.js 16** (App Router, server components, static generation)\n- **React 19** with TypeScript strict mode\n- **Tailwind CSS 4.1** (v4 CSS-first config)\n- **Bun** as package manager and runtime\n- **MDX / rendered markdown** for blog (file-based, no CMS)\n- **shiki / rehype-pretty-code** for syntax highlighting\n- **next-mdx-remote** or similar for markdown processing\n\nNo animation libraries (no Framer Motion, no GSAP, no R3F). Typography and whitespace carry the design.\n\n## Pages\n\n- **Profile** (`/`) — One-liner hero statement, contact links, bio as prose, projects as annotated bibliography entries\n- **Blog** (`/blog`) — Table-of-contents index, long-form essay posts rendered from markdown\n- **Resume** (`/resume`) — Embedded PDF or styled HTML with download\n\nNavigation is a publication masthead: `TH — Software Engineer · Profile · Blog · Resume · ☾`\n\n## Visual Language\n\n- **Layout**: Vertically structured, centered. Narrow readable column (~65–75ch). Large intentional margins. No sidebars, no card grids, no multi-column.\n- **Typography**: The main design feature. Book-like headings, comfortable line spacing (1.6–1.8), hierarchy via size not weight. Serif or quality sans-serif (e.g. IBM Plex, Literata, Inter).\n- **Color**: Rare and intentional. Light mode = paper white + dark ink + calm blue links. Dark mode = deep ink + soft off-white (feels like reading at night, not a code editor).\n- **Interaction**: Very restrained. Hover underlines, focus outlines, dark/light toggle only. No animations, no parallax, no 3D, no hover transforms.\n\n## Projects (displayed as bibliography entries, not cards)\n\n1. OpenAI Car Racing — imitation learning, LRP visualization\n2. Automated Barista — Niryo One robotic arm via ROS\n3. Ethereum Activity Analyzer — MAS compliance analysis\n4. i3 Ricing — tiling WM customization\n5. Handwaving Magicka — CV-based gesture game controller\n6. Badminton Court Bot — Telegram availability checker\n7. SUTD-MIT Global Leadership — electric boat\n8. Binary Sudoku — FPGA with programmable LEDs\n9.
